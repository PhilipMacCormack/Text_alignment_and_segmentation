# Text_alignment_and_segmentation
This project was part of my Master's Thesis Project spring 2023

The system takes an image of a handwritten page document as input and segments and aligns the image to a ground truth. In the case that a ground truth is not available, the algorithm allows for manual transcription of the segmentation. Where the segmentation fails to recognize text, it is possible to correct the boxes during the process.
